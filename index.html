	<h2>Delvin's Biography</h2>
	<p style="color:black;"> I was born on July 14 1999 in Garfield Hospital. I initially lived at Rowland Heights but eventually moved to West Covina and now reside in Chino Hills where I attend high school. I am a senior at Ayala High School and I hope one day to graduate with at least a degree so that I can be the first in my family to do so. By the way I am a pimp daddy at times. I am a big time noob with computers and technology. </p>
